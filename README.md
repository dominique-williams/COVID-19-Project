How to use Microsoft SQL Server to manipulate and analyze COVID-19 data from January 2020 to March 2021. I wanted to highlight trends of the pandemic from the start to the months leading up after vaccines were administered to the public. I queried the data to answer the following:
1.  What is the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in your country?
2. What percentage of the population caught COVID in each country?
3. Which countries have the highest infection rate compared to the population?
4. Which countries have the highest death count per population?
5. Which continent has the highest death count per population?
6. What percentage of the population has received at least one Covid Vaccine?

Analyzing this data was important because the pandemic marked a pivotal moment in my life. I wanted to be able to visualize and have a broader context of this real-life event. As someone who has survived the pandemic, creating this project has increased my gratitude and I hope it does the same for all who view it.
